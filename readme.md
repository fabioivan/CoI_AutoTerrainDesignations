# :pick: Automatic Terrain Designations
One Mine — One Click.

## :clipboard: Overview
Kayser’s Automatic Terrain Designations is a quality-of-life mod for Captain of Industry that **generates tailored mining designations for your mine towers**. Instead of manually creating designations across complex ore deposits, the mod analyzes terrain depth and places connected mining orders that follow the contours of the deposit. **Once you play with it, you do not want to go back**.

## :gear: Features
- **Create Designations** — Instantly designate all mineable ore within a mine tower's area
- **Generate Ramps** — Generate access ramps to connect new dig areas to the surface
- **Clear Designations** — Easily clear ATD mining designations within a tower's area
- See **Ore Composition** of the designation
- Set **Mining Priority** on tower level
- **Settings** to fine tune the designations
- **Corner Designations** for manual placement
- **Farmland Preparation** for preparing flat level designations into farmable ground

## :zap: Quick Start Guide
1. Select a mine tower
2. Ensure the tower area covers a body of some resource
3. Click **Create Designations** to generate designations
4. Adjust settings, clear designation, and recreate until happy
5. Watch your mining crews dig out the entire deposit
