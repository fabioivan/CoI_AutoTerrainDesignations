# Save removability — mandatory constraint
**ATD must be safe to remove from an existing save.** The mod must not leave ATD-only proto IDs or runtime scaffolding in the game's save file.

This rules out:
- Any permanent game-side serialization hooks (entity components, persisted mod records, custom save payloads, etc.).
- Persisting ATD-owned notification instances into the save. A saved active notification that references an ATD-only proto causes a `CorruptedSaveException` when the mod is absent on next load.
- Adding ad-hoc `INotificationsManager` / `NotifyOnce` calls outside the transient notification manager.

Allowed notification pattern:
- Register ATD notification protos only in `ATD.Notifications.cs`.
- Add `.MuteAudio()` to every ATD notification proto. Restoring transient notifications after autosave must not replay alarm sounds.
- Create/remove active ATD notifications only through the transient notification helpers in `ATD.Notifications.cs`.
- Before serialization, purge all active ATD notifications in `ISimLoopEvents.BeforeSave.AddNonSaveable`. The purge must remove both tracked notification IDs and any active notification whose proto ID is in the ATD notification ID list.
- After `ISaveManager.OnSaveDone`, re-add transient notifications only from runtime/world-derived state. Do not require any saved mod state to restore them.
- `DoNotSaveAttribute` may be useful for ATD-owned runtime bookkeeping, but it does not hide notification instances already stored inside Mafi's `NotificationsManager`; those must be actively removed before save.
- Vanilla notification protos may be used if their semantics match, because vanilla can deserialize them without the mod. ATD-owned protos require the purge-before-save path above.

# Versioning and release model
- **Local/alpha packages** (built via `build.ps1 -Package`): increment the letter suffix on each package — `0.2.5a`, `0.2.5b`, etc. Update both `manifest.json` and `changelog.txt` to the new letter version.
- **Public releases** (CoI Hub): collate all lettered alpha changes into a single new version (e.g. `0.2.5a + 0.2.5b + 0.2.5c → 0.2.6`). Update both `manifest.json` and `changelog.txt`.
- `manifest.json` version and the top `changelog.txt` entry must always match.
- Major and minor version increments only on user's request.
- Updated change log should always accompany a release package

# Externalize constants to settings file
If new constants or parameters are added to the mod, suggest that these be externalized into the settings file with clear descriptions, so power users can easily customize behavior without needing to modify code.

# Update change log with new features and fixes
After having added new features or fixes, suggest that the mod's change log be updated with clear descriptions of what was added or fixed, so users can easily see what's new in each version. If there is no entry for a new version, document unreleased changes in a new section at the end of the file for the upcoming version.

# Review API implementation for breaking changes and new features
After each major update, review the mod API implementation and suggest to update instructions with any new features, changes, or fixes that may impact users or modders. This ensures that the mod's documentation remains accurate and helpful for the community.

# Documentation maintenance
- ATD now uses an audience-split documentation tree under `docs/`:
  - `docs/player/` for player-facing usage docs
  - `docs/api/` for public API and modder-facing integration docs
  - `docs/dev/done/` for implemented architecture and settled behavior
  - `docs/dev/in-progress/` for systems that exist but are expected to change soon
  - `docs/dev/planned/` for future design notes that are not yet implemented
- When changing user-visible behavior, modder-facing APIs, or internal architecture, update the relevant docs in the same task when practical.
- Prefer replacing outdated planning docs with current implementation docs once a feature is shipped enough to describe concretely.
- Keep player docs free of internal-only implementation detail unless it directly affects player behavior.
- Keep dev docs explicit about what is implemented today versus what is expected to change soon.
- For file-specific doc maintenance rules, also load the docs instruction file in this repo when working under `docs/`.

# MaFi modding API Reference
Reference for general queries regarding e.g. the manifest file, mod structure, and API usage. For game-specific behavior, also check the Captain of Industry Wiki and Decompiled Source sections below.
- Captain of Industry modding documentation: https://github.com/MaFi-Games/Captain-of-industry-modding

# Captain of Industry Decompiled Source
- Decompiled game source code is in the `%APPDATA%\Captain of Industry\Mafi` directory. In this workspace, that folder is shown as **CoI Decompiled Source** (display name only), and from the mod root (`%APPDATA%\Captain of Industry\Mods\AutoTerrainDesignations`) the relative path is usually `..\..\Mafi`, not `..\Mafi`.
- When in doubt, resolve it with PowerShell instead of guessing a relative path:
  ```powershell
  Get-ChildItem -LiteralPath "$env:APPDATA\Captain of Industry" -Directory -Filter Mafi
  ```
- Use the decompiled source to inspect game logic, entity behavior, and API details when needed. Be mindful that decompiled code may not have original variable names or comments, so it may require some interpretation.

# Build verification
After every code change, run a Debug build to confirm the project compiles cleanly:
```powershell
dotnet build AutoTerrainDesignations.sln -c Debug
```
Fix any errors before proceeding. Do not leave a change in a broken build state.

# Logging and Debugging
- To inspect the latest part of the newest Captain of Industry log, run:
  ```powershell
  Get-ChildItem -LiteralPath "$env:APPDATA\Captain of Industry\Logs" -Filter "*.log" | Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Descending | Select-Object -First 1 | ForEach-Object { Get-Content -LiteralPath $_.FullName -Tail 220 }
  ```

## Log analysis scripts

### Confirm which mod build is loaded
ATD and AFD each emit a version + DLL timestamp line early in every game session:
```
I HH:MM:SS,mmm SNNNNNN ~Mai: [ATD] AutoTerrainDesignations vX.Y.Zn | dll: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
I HH:MM:SS,mmm SNNNNNN ~Mai: [AFD] AutoForestryDesignations vX.Y.Zn | dll: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
```
Compare the `dll:` timestamp against the DLL file's last-modified time to confirm the expected build was actually loaded. A mismatch means the game loaded an older build (stale bin output, wrong install path, etc.).

To show only these version rows from the newest log:
```powershell
.\tools\get-mod-log.ps1 -DllOnly
```

### Extract all mod-tagged rows
`tools/get-mod-log.ps1` grabs every line prefixed with `[ATD` or `[AFD` — version rows, warnings, errors, and performance logs — from the newest log (or a specified file):
```powershell
# All mod-tagged rows in the newest log
.\tools\get-mod-log.ps1

# Last 50 mod-tagged rows (useful for recent session activity)
.\tools\get-mod-log.ps1 -Last 50

# Use a specific log file
.\tools\get-mod-log.ps1 -LogPath "C:\...\26-05-17_08-56-26_5925.log"
```

### Extract ATD farming performance rows only
`tools/extract-atd-farming-perf.ps1` extracts only `[ATD Farming Perf]` lines:
```powershell
# All perf rows in the newest log
.\tools\extract-atd-farming-perf.ps1

# Last 20 perf rows
.\tools\extract-atd-farming-perf.ps1 -Last 20
```
